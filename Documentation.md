### Project Documentation: Video Processing Application in C++

#### Overview
This documentation outlines the steps taken to create a basic video processing application using C++ and OpenCV. The application is capable of opening and playing video files, with the infrastructure set up for future enhancements such as adjusting brightness and contrast.

#### Project Setup

1. **Development Environment Setup**:
   - **Compiler**: g++ (Ubuntu 13.2.0-23ubuntu4) 13.2.0
   - **Libraries**: OpenCV installed via `libopencv-dev`.

2. **Project Structure**:
   - **Directories**:
     ```
     video_processing_app/
     ├── include/
     │   └── video_processor.h
     ├── src/
     │   ├── main.cpp
     │   └── video_processor.cpp
     ├── media/
     │   └── sample_video.mp4
     ├── Makefile
     └── README.md
     ```
   - **Files**:
     - `include/video_processor.h`: Header file for video processing functions.
     - `src/main.cpp`: Main application file for opening and playing video files.
     - `src/video_processor.cpp`: Implementation of video processing functions.
     - `Makefile`: For building the project.
     - `README.md`: Project overview and build/run instructions.

#### Building the Project

1. **Makefile**:
   - Defined the compiler, source files, and build rules.
   - Used `pkg-config` to include OpenCV headers and link libraries.
   - Provided a `clean` target to remove the executable.

2. **Compilation and Execution**:
   - **Compile**:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - **Run**:
     ```bash
     ./video_app
     ```

#### Errors and Solutions

1. **Error: `QSocketNotifier: Can only be used with threads started with QThread`**:
   - **Cause**: Qt threading issues, possibly due to the application running in a Wayland session.
   - **Solution**: Force the application to use the X11 platform by setting the environment variable:
     ```bash
     export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
     ./video_app
     ```

2. **Error: `Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "canberra-gtk-module"`**:
   - **Cause**: Missing GTK modules for sound event handling.
   - **Solution**: Install the required GTK modules:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libcanberra-gtk-module libcanberra-gtk3-module
     ```

3. **Error: `symbol lookup error: /snap/core20/current/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0: undefined symbol: __libc_pthread_init, version GLIBC_PRIVATE`**:
   - **Cause**: Conflicts or issues within the snap environment.
   - **Solution**: Run the application outside of the snap environment and unset conflicting environment variables:
     ```bash
     unset GTK_PATH
     export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb
     ./video_app
     ```

4. **Application Window Closes Immediately**:
   - **Cause**: Possible logic errors or missing video file.
   - **Solution**: Add debug output to trace execution and verify the existence and accessibility of the video file.

#### Debugging and Verification

1. **Add Debug Output**:
   - Insert print statements in `main.cpp` to trace execution flow and identify where the application might be terminating unexpectedly.

2. **Verify Video File**:
   - Ensure the video file exists in the specified path and is readable:
     ```bash
     ls -l media/sample_video.mp4
     ```

3. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Verify all required libraries are correctly linked using `ldd`:
     ```bash
     ldd ./video_app
     ```

4. **Install Necessary Codecs**:
   - Ensure multimedia codecs are installed:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
     ```

5. **Permissions**:
   - Ensure the `media` directory and video file have appropriate permissions:
     ```bash
     chmod 755 media
     chmod 644 media/sample_video.mp4
     ```

### Summary
This documentation provides a structured approach to setting up, building, and troubleshooting a basic video processing application using C++ and OpenCV. By following the outlined steps and solutions, one can ensure the application runs smoothly and is set up for future enhancements. If further issues arise, detailed debugging and verification steps are provided to help identify and resolve them.
